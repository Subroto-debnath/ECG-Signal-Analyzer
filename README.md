# Fault-Tolerant-at-Combinational-Circuits
This Project is the implementation of the Paper "[A new approach to extract features from ECG signals](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7391944)". The application is designed for doctors which is able to denoise, remove baseline, extract parameters from an ECG signa. Based on extracting parameters, it can detect diseases corresponding to featureâ€™s value of an ECG Signal.

## Requirements 
* MatLab 

## Usage
* Need a data set of an ECG Signal.
* The experimental studies show that the proposed method provides 96.79% accuracy and 5 features recognition with reduced computational complexity.
