# ECG-Signal-Analyzer
This Project is the implementation of the Paper "[A new approach to extract features from ECG signals](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7391944)". The application is designed for doctors which is able to denoise, remove baseline, extract parameters from an ECG signal. Based on extracting parameters, it can detect diseases corresponding to feature’s value of an ECG Signal.

## Requirements 
* MatLab 

## Usage
* Need a data set of an ECG Signal.
* The experimental studies show that the proposed method provides 96.79% accuracy and 5 features recognition with reduced computational complexity.
